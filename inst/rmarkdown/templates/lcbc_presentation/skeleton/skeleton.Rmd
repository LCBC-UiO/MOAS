### Start editing after this

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Here you can place global options for the entire document.
# Mostly used for knitr settings, but can also load data etc.
# Whatever happens here will not show in the presentation.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Heading 1
There are several heading levels. 

## Heading 2
depending on your hierarchy

maybe some latex math? 
$$\large x = \frac{y}{z} $$

And some **bold** and  _italics_ text? 

Three dashes make a new slide

## Add some R code
```{r}
library(ggseg)
ggseg()
```

---

## Create two columns and mute the R code
.pull-right[
This text goes in the right-hand column, while the plot is placed in the left-hand column
]
.pull-left[
```{r, echo=F}
ggseg(atlas = yeo7, 
      position="stacked",
      mapping = aes(fill=area),
      show.legend = F) + 
  scale_fill_brain("yeo7")
```

class: inverse, middle, center

# You can also have some special slides
## by specifying classes right after the `---`

---
class: dark, middle

# or even with a dark slide!
because dark is cool, right?
