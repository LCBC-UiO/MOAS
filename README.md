MOAS convenience functions
================
Athanasia Mowinckel

The functions in this package are intended for use on the Mother of All Spreadsheets (and related files) in LCBC. The functions will mostly not work on any other data, it is an in-house package of functions.

The package can be installed using devtools:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LCBC-UiO/MOAS")
```

The functions are now installed, and you may load them when you want to use them. All functions are documented in standard R fashion. The package also has a vignette, to help you get started using it. You can access it [here](inst/doc/MOAS.html), or via R:

``` r
library(MOAS)
vignette("MOAS")
```
