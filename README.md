MOAS convenience functions
================
Athanasia Mowinckel

The functions in this package are intended for use on the Mother of All Spreadsheets (and related files) in LCBC. The functions will mostly not work on any other data, it is an in-house package of functions.

The package can be installed using devtools:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LCBC-UiO/MOAS")
```

The functions are now loaded for your use and are documented.
