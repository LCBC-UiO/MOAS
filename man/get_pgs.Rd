\title{Read in and sort PGS data}
\usage{
get_pgs(pgs = c("AD", "AD_Jansen"), s_levels = c("S1", "S7", "S11"),
  pgs_path = "~/LCBC/Projects/Cross_projects/Genetics/PGS/PGS_20190618/PGS_wAPOE/",

  include_cnt = FALSE, include_genetics_debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pgs}{character vector of the PGS wanted}

\item{s_levels}{character vector of the significance levels wanted}

\item{pgs_path}{path to the directory where the PGS's are stored}

\item{genetic_match_file}{path to the file containing the MOAS-genetics
matching and debugging information}

\item{include_cnt}{logical, whether to keep SNP count information}

\item{include_genetics_debug}{logical, whether to keep all columns
in the genetic_match_file in the final output}
}
\value{
a tibble / data.frame
}
\description{
Given the path containing PGS data, this function will read in
PGS data for the PGS's specified and the significance levels
provided. In order to correctly only keep rows of data from
verified sources, the genetic_match_file is necessary to
provide for a check.
